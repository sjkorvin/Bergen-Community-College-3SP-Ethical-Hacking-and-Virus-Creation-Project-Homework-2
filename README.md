# Bergen-Community-College-3SP-Ethical-Hacking-and-Virus-Creation-Project-Homework-2

I had coded this assignment in Code::Blocks on Linux because of how much easier it is to work with third-party libraries on Linux as opposed to Windows. The third-party libraries used were the Boost C++ libraries, libcurl, and xlnt found at https://github.com/tfussell/xlnt. For part 3 of this assignment, I had used this template provided by Phidgets: https://www.phidgets.com/?view=articles&article=LIBCURLHowTo.

Part 1 of the assignment creates 50 directories, outputs a message to the console as each directory is created, and gives the user a choice in deleting the created directories.

Part 2 of the assignment modifies a student's grade in a .xlsx file from A to F.

Part 3 of this assignment creates a directory called "SteveOS" in my home folder, creates a file called in "hacked_system.txt" in the SteveOS directory, deletes the hacked_system.txt file, and emails me a warning message saying that the file has been deleted. The app password for my Google account in my code has been removed.
